      "Description :  Senior Engineering Product ManagerAs a member of the Service Provider Engineering team, you will be responsible for managing the development of broadband DSL products targeted at service providers that provide Home Gateway, voice gateways, wireless adapters, IPTV and Voice over IP (VoIP) services. These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies: DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.  The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors. A word from the Recruiter: \"Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door.\" \"Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity.\" This is what not shared on the JD. \"How you will mature your career.\" Job Responsibilities: • For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies. It is expected that projects should be managed with minimal supervision. • Project management. Develop and maintain project plans. Keep all stakeholders informed of product status at all times• Project Execution. Manage the suppliers' (ODM, chip vendor, etc.) product development process. • Product Verification. Manage verification testing of product features and performance. • Customer Certification. Manage qualification of products with customers.• Documentation.

      "Description :  We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us. Contact us with your resume (preferred), or call the Hiring Manager  with your information for possible interview.•    Compensation: 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management\n",

      "Description :  We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us. Contact us with your resume (preferred), or call the Hiring Manager  with your information for possible interview.•    Compensation: 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management\n",

      "Description :  We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us. Contact us with your resume (preferred), or call the Hiring Manager  with your information for possible interview.•    Compensation: 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management\n",

      "Description :  We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us. Contact us with your resume (preferred), or call the Hiring Manager  with your information for possible interview.•    Compensation: 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management\n",

      "Description :  Senior Engineering Product ManagerAs a member of the Service Provider Engineering team, you will be responsible for managing the development of broadband DSL products targeted at service providers that provide Home Gateway, voice gateways, wireless adapters, IPTV and Voice over IP (VoIP) services. These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies: DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.  The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors. A word from the Recruiter: \"Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door.\" \"Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity.\" This is what not shared on the JD. \"How you will mature your career.\" Job Responsibilities: • For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies. It is expected that projects should be managed with minimal supervision. • Project management. Develop and maintain project plans. Keep all stakeholders informed of product status at all times• Project Execution. Manage the suppliers' (ODM, chip vendor, etc.) product development process. • Product Verification. Manage verification testing of product features and performance. • Customer Certification. Manage qualification of products with customers.• Documentation. Provide input for manuals, help files, application notes, marketing materials and tech support.• Support. Resolve any 3 rd level technical support escalations. • Track industry technology developments, supplier roadmaps, standards bodies and make product recommendations\n",

      "Description :  MCA Associates receive $80.00 (EIGHTY DOLLARS) and up for each membership submitted; MCA associates also receive residual monthly income from the members and associates they personally sign up. Sign up just two individuals per day—as either members or associates—and generate a $1,120.00 per week income. Receive a weekly paper check (delivered by UPS) or have your check direct deposited into your own bank account. You can receive your first paycheck the following Friday after you begin your work at home career with MCA—if you receive signups before the weekly company deadline, which falls on Saturday at 12 a.m., Central time. To begin with MCA, all you need to do it pay for your own benefit membership for the first and last month. You are NOT paying to work; you are paying for your benefits. You would not want to receive a haircut from someone who has never cut hair before, would you? You need to have the benefits in order to properly sell the benefits package and understand how good the benefits are. Keep in mind, that when you signup just one other person, you have doubled what you paid to begin! You have nothing to lose! (Note: Your initial plan payment may be paid by either debit card or credit card (IE- Visa, Master Card, American Express or Discover). Plan payments may also be made with an active checking account; however, there is a delay in the clearing of funds, which will also delay your coverage and the ability to start signing up members. This opportunity is a serious business; I can assure you that this is a wonderful and profitable decision, which will positively affect your financial future. \n",

Then establish what you think the price is going to be for the product and then that should lead to T amount of profit which should boost the stock by some amount.  I don't even think the person needs to give a predicted stock price just what the upside is in terms of profit.  If they can calculate a stock price that's obviously beneficial.ALSO I DONT WANT JUST FINANCE MAJORS.  WE NEED TO SEE A DIVERSITY OF TALENT FROM MULTIPLE DIFFERENT MAJORS AND I WOULD LOVE TO PUT TOGETHER A TEAM WITH SOME SCIENCE STUDENTS ON IT.\n",

      "Description :  We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us. Contact us with your resume (preferred), or call the Hiring Manager  with your information for possible interview.•    Compensation: 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management\n",

      "Description :  We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us. Contact us with your resume (preferred), or call the Hiring Manager  with your information for possible interview.•    Compensation: 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management\n",
